<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Jakarta, February 12, 2019</strong> - Regarding the momentum of the national press day that was just commemorated on 9 February, J&amp;T Express as an Indonesian shipping service company that focuses on e-Commerce business invited a number of media partners to visit the largest sorting center owned by J&amp;T Express. Located in Rawa Bokor, Tangerang this sorting center is the first sorting center in Indonesia which has the most complete range of facilities. On this occasion the media partners had the opportunity to visit the operational area of the manual sorting machine, automatic sorting machine and the monitoring center area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As we all know, J&amp;T Express has had an automatic sorting machine since December 2018, which has also been used as an anticipation of increased packages that occur in 2018 harbolnas and plays an important role in the efficiency of packet distribution during peak season. The machine that can do sorting to 180 destinations in one round can also sort up to 30,000 packages per hour so as to minimize the occurrence of errors and more time efficiency.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only automatic sorting machines, J&amp;T Express continues to work on improving technology through the procurement of X-ray machines themselves. The use of X-ray machines aims to streamline the inspection of the contents of packages which are usually done at the airport, by cutting the time it is expected to provide a better SLA (service level agreement). This X-ray machine will officially be used as of March 2019, where the X-Ray machine has received certification and operating permission from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and is currently awaiting the finalization of the assessment of the airlines.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Entering its fourth year, J&amp;T Express continues to develop technology and internet adaptation to realize its vision of being the best ecommerce delivery service in Southeast Asia. This is as revealed by Yohanes, Cargo and Operation Manager of J&amp;T Express &quot;The sorting center is a crucial part of the operations of shipping service companies, so J&amp;T Express continues to strive to maximize its operations through the use of qualified technology and trained human resources. We have also adapted this to the J&amp;T Express sorting machines in other countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam, where the similarity of technology and machinery used reached 90% like in Indonesia. &quot;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition to developing automatic sorting machines and independent x-ray machines, all J&amp;T Express drop points in Indonesia are also equipped with CCTV to monitor internal performance and distribution of packages received or sent. All CCTVs are centrally connected at the J&amp;T Express Jakarta gateway with a monitoring center facility that is connected to more than 2000 branches in Indonesia and will continue to grow. This monitoring center makes it easy to monitor operational procedures that occur in the field so as to minimize the occurrence of errors.</span></p><p><br/></p> </div>

The reason is, the logistics industry has a bigger role than just delivering goods in an efficient time to customers.

Based on this, E-commerce has an important role in accelerating the development of the digital economy which is dominated by MSMEs. Quoting Deputy Minister of Trade Jerry Sambuaga in his talk show with the theme Education on the Digitalization of East Java Markets, Stalls &amp; MSMEs, by 2022 there will be 20,997,131 MSMEs that have been digitized.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Seeing this reality, MSMEs and logistics companies have a strategic relationship that can support even more digital economic growth.

In her daily life, Hj. Mirna runs her business, namely selling clothes. She pioneered this business by starting to market to neighbors around where he lived, at home by utilizing a car garage and trying to go online through Facebook until it continued to increase to a further reach. Every day there are always up to 30 orders that she has to send and she entrusts them to use J&amp;T Express because it serves 365 days of delivery.<br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">However, the pandemic this year had an impact on his business and there was a decline in sales, she also experienced difficulties when the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) were set and a lockdown was imposed in his area, resulting in her business being on hiatus for 2 months, she also had to restart so that her business could continue last. Therefore Hj.

Based on the development of internet technology, J&amp;T Express offers a new experience for customers to use shipping services that are easy, fast and reliable.<br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As of March 2016 J&amp;T Express is ready to serve all customers by reaching the entire archipelago with more than 700 drop points in 381 cities in Indonesia.

Of course it&#39;s everyone&#39;s hope when sending packages. But not a few are also not as expected, it is not uncommon for packages to arrive at their destination, even packages that are no longer perfect.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">This incident factor is often interpreted as an error from the express, yes indeed the express company must always maintain its service and system continuously because the shipping service business requires high service consistency. But consumers also need to make sure they have followed the procedures they should do. Here are some tips for sending packages safely, clearly and quickly.<br\/><\/span><\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>1. Find Out and Get to Know Your Express Services<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As consumers we have the right to choose the express service used, so before sending a package, it is better to find out the reputation and delivery system of the express service that you will use such as estimated shipping, rates, and area coverage. It is also important to find out who to contact if there is a problem with your package at any time, so you know where to complain.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>2. Pack your package well and safely<\/strong><br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The contents of our package are certainly very valuable, in order to keep the contents of the package from being damaged it is best to package it properly. For example, if you want to send cookies, it&#39;s better to coat the jar with bubble plastic before packing it in a box so that it doesn&#39;t get exposed to a heavy pile. If you are still worried enough, use insurance services to guarantee your package in the event of loss or damage.<br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>3. Write down the Full Address Description<\/strong><br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Don&#39;t assume that all-knowing couriers, incomplete recipient addresses will sometimes make it difficult for couriers to deliver packages, this tends to slow down the delivery period. It is recommended that you attach complete recipient information such as RT \/ RW, postcode, and block name if the address is in a complex area. Also include the recipient&#39;s telephone number so that the courier can be contacted if you have trouble finding an address.<br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>4. Save Receipt Number Well<\/strong><br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">After sending the package we only need to wait for the package to be delivered, don&#39;t forget to save the transaction receipt that includes the receipt number, so you can find out the status of your package. Some express services have provided package tracking facilities, the receipt number also functions as a number that we can report if our delivery has a problem.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">J&amp;T Express is one of the express services that provides tracking systems for its customers, this independent tracking system is somewhat different from express services in general. This tracking facility allows customers to find out the status, details of package existence, to the name of the recipient of the package. J&amp;T Express also provides E-tracking information, information in the form of SMS that is automatically received after sending, while the information provided is in the form of status and receipt numbers to the sender and recipient of the package. Really make it easy for consumers right?<\/span><\/p>","freleasedate":"2016-04-19"}]}]},{"2015":[{"December":[{"fid":97,"fadddate":"2020-01-17 10:54:31","fimg":"\/indexUploads\/images\/20200117\/042be793bbea06f75aab1332c829f43d.jpg,\/indexUploads\/images\/20200117\/91006e52d432dde5e5c07e6a22cf7fd4.jpg,\/indexUploads\/images\/20200117\/a4dc1a3eb465fa99f0ed458df0d26445.jpg","lang_title":"J&T Express Family's First Christmas","lang_bi":"","lang_content":"<p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The J&amp;T Express family celebrates the first Christmas holiday on December 24, 2015.
