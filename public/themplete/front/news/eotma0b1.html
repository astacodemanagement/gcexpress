Every package that comes in and is sorted is his responsibility, but unlike land delivery in general, he actually has to race against time to get across the island using a speedboat to the Panipahan Island area in Riau Province.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The main challenge he must be able to face is the erratic operating hours for speedboat departures on the island, resulting in problems with delivery of packages. In fact, he once had to deliver a package from the office to the port, a distance of approximately 8 - 12 km. To anticipate sufficient delivery time, Fadli made the delivery earlier in order to maximize delivery to the destination speedboat. Fadli&#39;s strategy becomes effective when there is a point determined by the customer, so he arranges a delivery time appointment with the customer so he can prioritize the package on the speedboat delivery route.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Among his activities in sending packages there is always a unique experience, the most memorable one he has experienced is when a customer gives more than the cash on delivery (COD) value, because they cannot always carry all the packages across the island, usually they have collaborated with the speedboat operator to entrust them. customer package, then the customer will deposit the COD costs through the officer. However, he also experienced something unpleasant when there was a customer who did not leave the COD costs with the officer, so that day he had to bear the shipping costs.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In a day he is able to send as many as 150 packages on normal days, even up to 350 packages during peak season. Of course, he always makes appointments to meet customers at a mutually determined place and time to streamline his travel route every day. According to him, changes in people&#39;s behavior in the area to online shopping have become a convenience for customers there, especially since deliveries can still arrive even if they have to cross the island.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&quot;Before there was an online method, the majority of people would shop directly at markets in the city, and now it is easier for people because they can make deliveries directly to their destination without having to go to the city,&quot; concluded Fadli.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From everything he faced when carrying out his duties delivering customer packages, Fadli never felt burdened, because for him this job was not just delivering goods but a mandate that he had to complete until it reached the recipient. And everyone has the right to feel happiness even if they are at the end of the island.</span></p> </div>

His journey began as a sprinter, a position he found through social media (Facebook), where his main task was to deliver packages. After working as a sprinter for about a year, Hasbul was promoted to Supervisor (SPV).<\/span><\/p><br\/><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&quot;I was a Supervisor for just eight months, and then, thankfully, I was promoted again to Assistant Regional Manager,&quot; Hasbul recalls. He attributes this promotion to his hard work and ability to manage deliveries during the early days of J&amp;T Express&#39;s Pamekasan area operations. He held the position of Assistant Regional Manager for two consecutive years.<\/span><\/p><br\/><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In June 2024, he returned to the role of Supervisor but continued with the responsibilities of an Assistant Regional Manager. According to him, the area still requires an Assistant Regional Manager due to its large coverage, so he now holds dual roles as Supervisor and Assistant Regional Manager, overseeing seven Drop Points in Sumenep Regency.<\/span><\/p><br\/><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&quot;You could say I truly started my career here from the bottom. From being a sprinter to my current position, I&#39;ve experienced many ups and downs. As a sprinter, I was often underestimated by customers and compared to other delivery services,&quot; Hasbul shared.<\/span><\/p><br\/><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As a sprinter, Hasbul used to deliver packages covering nearly 45KM daily because, in 2016, there was only one drop point in Pamekasan. He spent most of his day on the road, often completing deliveries by 7 PM before continuing with package pickups.<\/span><\/p><br\/><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&quot;In 2016, even picking up a single package was a big deal for the Pamekasan area.

Hafiz, who at that time had minimal work experience, tried his best to carry out his duties, including distributing flyers to shopping centers, shops and traditional markets to increase customers.

He once experienced a unique incident when he arrived at the recipient&#39;s address, not realizing that the owner of the house had a dog and it immediately started barking right in front of him, then he stepped on the gas spontaneously while bringing the package back.

Here he is responsible for managing the administration of the rotation and sorting of packages, but there are times when he has to experience the hardest things when serving complaints that come directly to the point of having arguments.

Dewi does not deny that her job as a Kubang Drop Point courier for the Pekanbaru - Riau area is a big challenge for her. Starting from the scorching hot weather to the heavy rain that sometimes hits her in the middle of the journey, coupled with the traffic jams that she often experiences, everything is part of Dewi&#39;s daily struggle in delivering packages.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">One of the challenges that Dewi has faced is the difficulty in finding the delivery address.

Assigned in the Call Center division, Santy had to undergo several training periods before going directly to carry out his responsibilities in that section.

One of the challenges that he often faces is complaints from recipients of cash on delivery (COD) packages, where the contents of the package ordered by the buyer do not match the goods ordered, so he has to return to the customer&#39;s address to explain the COD service flow directly, because it is still there are those who don&#39;t understand, he patiently provides explanations for education.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Maintaining good relationships with customers is a strategy he uses to be able to manage daily delivery times. &quot;I have to reassure customers that every day the courier has a time limit for delivering packages and ensures that the package is picked up before the estimated limit, so that it can provide understanding to customers and complete it on time,&quot; said <strong>Isapii<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Isa proves that dedication and perseverance are the keys to success in her work. Despite the difficult terrain and extreme weather, Isa is always determined to deliver every package safely and on a well-scheduled basis. He also understands the importance of providing the best service to customers, making them feel appreciated and satisfied with J&amp;T Express services.

Even though he lives in a remote area, he is able to connect remote villages with the outside world through the J&amp;T Express delivery service. This inspiring journey teaches about the determination, dedication and passion needed to achieve goals, even in the most difficult situations.

Because shipping routes are always changing, sometimes it is quite difficult to arrange it so that it can adjust the time according to the SLA, even so, Halawa continues to adapt to whatever obstacles he faces so that once a customer takes his job as a courier for granted, but for him it is not a problem as a delivery service worker he must be able to serve humbly, he believes there are still many who appreciate even the smallest work out there.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\u201cI really enjoy my job as a sprinter, because every day I get to meet different people.

For about 2 years working to supervise the Singkawang DP which he did well, he was again entrusted to handle 3 operational points at once in one delivery door, namely the Singkawang Drop Center. The challenges he faces are even greater, because he must be able to manage the rotation of all shipping areas in Singkawang, including strengthening the sprinter team so that operations can run smoothly. his strategy to be able to form a solid team is to approach and embrace. Slowly from the small things he pays attention to and discusses together until all work constraints are resolved properly.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Despite her efforts in organizing work, Halawa has also experienced pressure that drained his energy. At that time, it was the first day the Singkawang Drop Center was operating, coinciding with peak season shipments, coupled with no experience dealing with this center of gravity and all package rotation in the Singkawang area became one door. Gradually he manages all distribution channels from incoming packages, sorting to delivery. With the extraordinary hard work of the team, in the end it was able to pass well. There had been a complaint from the customer because the goods received were not suitable, while there were no problems with the delivery, he went down directly to mediate the problem and finally it was resolved.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Despite the tough hurdles he is going through, Halawa was awarded the Best SPV Employee in the Operations category in 2021.

From his journey while working, he is very grateful because he gets a lot of experiences, both good and bad things, and everything is done with enthusiasm and not burdened. Another good thing that became a new experience for him was being able to work with the police and BNN, where there had been a shipment containing prohibited goods bound for Manado, and the authorities had caught him.

At that time, he immediately faced the peak season of Ramadan in 2020, without lingering, he completed all his tasks by sending up to more than 300 packages per day. Unexpectedly, after the moment of Ramadhan until Eid was over, Hasby was accepted to continue working and he took this opportunity even though he had not memorized the route there, with the sincere intention of working to earn a living he slowly learned according to the existing procedures. He made a minimum target of 100 awb\/day to be sent for better results, and successfully completed the start of the delivery of only 2 sub-districts covering 6 villages, increasing to 3 sub-districts with approximately 33 villages.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">By setting targets that maximize his work performance, a year later Hasby was entrusted with becoming the Coordinator for the Jatinangor coverage area, because a number of old employees there had transferred areas, it was a new challenge for him to take on and try to build a team of admins and sprinters for all coverage areas there independently . The ups and downs in forming the team did not stop him from trying, he even experienced a decline in the first 2 months, and was slowly improved until he was back to normal and managed to become one of the best in Sumedang at that time.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Entering the first quarter of 2022, Hasby was asked for managerial and audit assistance in several areas of Sumedang because there were system improvements and vacant employee positions, resulting in a decrease in performance in that area and he had to hold 2 different areas to run. It turned out that the operational conditions at that time were enough to drain his energy to be able to return things to normal, he even experienced complaints from customers regarding standard packing, return packages and miss routes due to a lack of good team communication and education. damaged shipments and not promptly resolved.

He delivers to customers&#39; addresses from 30 to 100 packages a day, because not enough packages are still coming in. Zanu was confused about how to arrange it for delivery and pick up of packages on the same day. So he takes advantage of the opportunity to be friendly with customers when delivering packages as well as leaving business cards to make it easier for customers if there is a need for shipping orders using J&amp;T Express.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The method of entrusting the business card turned out to be fruitless, because many people around him did not know and believe in J&amp;T Express, he did various other methods such as creating a fanpage group on Facebook and one of them was providing free shipping to start proving it to customers that it was true that the delivery was fast. and safe, and slowly starting to gain trust, especially helping to gain awareness through social media. However, the challenge at that time was carrying out the task on his own, because he was the one who disseminated information for orders and had to be able to pick up and pick up packages to new customers, and even once received orders at night from quite a distance but only in the form of 1 package. Considering that his business to get customers is not an easy thing, this is not an obstacle for him to continue to grow.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">His persistence continued to strengthen Zanu&#39;s work performance, and a year later he was trusted to become the Drop Point coordinator for the Yogyakarta City area. The new challenge he felt during the peak season where he and his team had the main commitment at that time was how the delivery to the Jogja city area would run normally and there would be no buildup, everyone had to be able to work together to solve the surge in shipments. By arranging the distribution of delivery routes per sub-district, Zanu also directly helps his team deliver packages when a co-worker is sick. Armed with previous experience as a Sprinter, it made it easier for him to give directions and all packages were sent on time. He also always applied a disciplined attitude towards time while working, so that he was able to strengthen the team and produce good results, until he was trusted again to assume responsibility as Drop Point Supervisor for the Yogyakarta and Kulon Progo city areas.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The greater the responsibility held, the greater the risk that will be faced. In order to survive and develop, Zanu applies 5 important points to become his work strategy, the first is Analysis, how to divide tasks according to ability analysis, especially the delivery and pick up team. The second is the Potential Customer Census, to be able to filter new customers through data management. Third, Delivery service education, providing education to sellers regarding the required service facilities. Fourth, a strong Support Team, including transporters, processing, admins to monitor all problems that occur so that they can be resolved immediately. And fifth is good relations with customers, the importance of maintaining relationships by communicating or visiting intensely will foster a sense of trust.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 2em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Committed to carrying out this strategy, Zanu managed to increase his fantastic turnover, and became the highest achievement for the Yogyakarta area, so he was also awarded the Best Supervisor 2021. His performance continues to improve and brings changes that have led his career to continue to rise. Loyalty to work and responsibility led Zanu to be entrusted with becoming the Regional Manager of J&amp;T Express Yogyakarta.

The people around the area of work can be said to still not know the J&amp;T Express, here he feels there is a need for marketing increases in order to be more advanced. Slowly he introduced the Delivery of J&amp;T Express to prospective customers while delivering the package.

His dedication for approximately 1 year of work and good work performance, made him trusted to carry out a greater task as a supervisor of the Bireuen Regency. He had felt a little confused how to start this new responsibility, where the scope area was included in the area that was not yet developed. Hoitami also made some changes from guiding human resources to form a solid team, and try to get closer to customers, one of them always accommodates various customer complaints, and this is an interesting learning according to him, where with this he can try to understand the needs of customers and improve services.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Hoitami strengthened marketing in the area of his scope at that time, while together with the team trying to fix a better Perayana and socialize the delivery of J&amp;T Express to the surrounding community. As a result, for this area the community is increasingly familiar with the delivery of J&amp;T Express and shipping increases, from before only one drop point, now began to develop and increase up to 3 drop points for the coverage of several districts in the Bireuen region.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Successful maximizing his work apparently did not immediately make him relieved, to level up he was promoted to take the Regional Manager test and get the responsibility for the coverage of the middle area in Aceh.

At that time, Adhil sent packages to the area ranging from 50 to 80 packages every day. It doesn&#39;t sound like much, but the travel route is quite time-consuming to be able to catch all the packages to the recipient on the same day. Even though the weather is not always good, he is always enthusiastic about carrying out his duties so that the delivery remains smooth and on time.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">As is generally when working in the field, Adhil also experienced difficulties when delivering packages to areas prone to conflicts between residents where when passing through this route, several people intercepted him and were asked about the ease of entering the area. Adhil tried to answer calmly and indicated that he wanted to send the package. . to customers. However, they were not allowed to pass and they were asked to contact the recipient to pick up the package at that location, with good intentions he explained to the residents guarding the area there but the result was zero, and it was forbidden to pass through that road there.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Because he still had to bring quite a lot of other packages to be delivered, he was forced to contact the recipient and explain slowly, the recipient who was lucky to understand the situation finally had to wait until the recipient arrived. This incident caused Adhil&#39;s delivery time to be shortened, but he is grateful that there was no harsh treatment such as threats or forced taking of the package. This was prevented because there were frequent hit-and-runs in the area, forcing a number of residents to limit road access there. Adhil also set a strategy to contact the beneficiary in advance if there are other packages with a similar purpose, so that the process is always smooth and not delayed.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">After working as a sprinter for about 1 year, Adhil was trusted to become a Transporter, namely shipping with longer routes using operational cars to distribute packages to the East Biak, West Biak and North Biak areas. The distance to each location is approximately 100 km, the focus of the work is to deliver the packages according to the destination schedule, then proceed with pulling the packages or receiving packages that enter the Gateway to be sorted according to the intended sub-district. Unexpectedly, there had been a case of racism which also raged in the Biak area, Papua. Due to many access constraints, Adhi and the team had to rearrange the delivery route as much as possible to avoid chaos but also consider security when sending packages.

Since joining J&amp;T Express East Java in September 2020, Bagus has always been eager to carry out his task of compiling a package delivery route to racing against time in the field to complete the delivery to the recipient&#39;s address. However, there is a Cash On Delivery (COD) package which he believes does not match the type of item in the data, Bagus could have handed over the package and received the cost of the item but he couldn&#39;t bear to let this go. Therefore, he immediately confirms to the recipient and provides an explanation as an education to customers that there is a fraudulent motive that will result in loss of COD fees.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&quot;It&#39;s uncertain every day there are packages that have problems, especially the COD package, I feel sorry if the recipient has paid for it but the item doesn&#39;t match, so I explain that it&#39;s best to just return it, the item will automatically return to the seller&quot;, said Bagus.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">He added that the package will only be returned if the recipient has confirmed it, so as not to misunderstand in the future.

Bagus can send up to 150 packages per day, no doubt he has to be careful in arranging shipping routes so that there is enough time to finish everything on that day. The layout of the package is the right choice for him according to the route to facilitate loading and unloading of goods at the location.

If on that day he finds a package that is odd, especially on the COD service, he places it on the last route of delivery, the goal is not to interfere with the delivery time of other packages. Usually Bagus always records the moment when there is such a fraudulent mode package, he uses it as educational vlog content on social media related to COD package fraud with the simple goal of being an inspiration to share with others. Unexpectedly one of his vlogs turned out to be reaping positive comments from the public, many who supported him for doing good and preventing the COD package fraud mode.

In addition, he also had an unpleasant experience, namely almost being beaten by the recipient&#39;s family, because the goods received were not suitable and immediately shouted at Bagus and were chased because they wanted to continue with another delivery, even until they were held by some people like swindlers who were caught red-handed.

The man who is familiarly called Pandu is tireless, thanks to his dedication and high contribution, he has led him to achieve various achievements, namely Grade A admin certification in 2020 and 2022 as well as being the Best Employee of The Year 2022 in the East Java area.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Starting with the intention of wanting to start a career after graduating from college in the field of economics, Pandu applied as an Admin at J&amp;T Express who unexpectedly had explored this 3 years of his career and had several double jobs. \u201cFirst of all, I can&#39;t bear to see that my co-workers are still not finished, while my work is finished, the problem is that even though they are in different positions, they are still in one branch, but teamwork is the main thing.

While at the previous location, he was also the coordinator. Sometimes I also help the sprinter to pick up the package because there is only 1 sprinter and then at another drop point I was placed, I did everything from admin, sprinter, spv to coordinator\u201d.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Of course, as an admin, Pandu also meets and communicates directly with customers. Because of his familiarity with customers, Pandu is often brought food by customers when they drop off packages. Despite such familiarity, Pandu still adheres to the company&#39;s rules, especially regarding the package delivery procedure. He was once scolded by customers because he rejected fraud packages or packages that were not up to standard.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Working for a living forced Pandu to stay away from his family.

Not only that, the road in Ciwidey is also steep, so to facilitate the delivery process as a PIC area, Ade is trying to find a solution. &quot;Currently, we are trying to use a car boost on each trip, at least in the middle of the road we have a standby car whose contents the sprinter will send the package, and so that later the sprinter is not far away to take the next trip package again,&quot; added Ade.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Prior to joining J&amp;T Express, initially this man from Ciwidey worked in the Cikarang area for several years before returning to his hometown which turned out to provide an opportunity for a career path that he did not expect to get. &quot;The longest I&#39;ve worked at J&amp;T Express.

At that time there were still minimal Drop Points in the area so that the scope of package delivery was quite wide, the distance to deliver 1 to 2 packages was around 30 Km from one point to another.

Over time, for approximately 6 years working with different responsibilities, Riefky has faced a tough challenge, namely to restore consumer confidence in his work area within 2 to 3 months. Even though he realized that it was not easy, he started by solving problems one by one and improving his work system, starting from the pattern of team work, the circulation of money in the COD and DFOD systems, to the resolution of customer complaints which were quite high.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">A trust is a great compliment.

Applying to work as a sprinter for J&amp;T Express Drop Point Dompu \u2013 West Nusa Tenggara since September 2020, Farid admitted that working at J&amp;T Express is better than the previous job he did in the city of Tangerang. Being a sprinter is certainly a new experience, apart from the fact that he likes the countryside and wants to be close to his family, he feels that his pleasure in socializing is one of the factors that decides he applies as a sprinter in his parents&#39; hometown.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Of course, growing up in a different city from today makes Farid need adaptation, especially communicating with local Dompu residents who still use the regional language and also have very different characters and habits from the capital. His adaptability and communication skills have made Farid loved by the residents of Dompu and earned him the nickname &quot;honest person&quot; by one of the customers. When it comes to customers, I&#39;m never too formal, but I&#39;m always joking, asking how they&#39;re doing and smiling so I&#39;m more familiar.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Just like sprinters in general, of course Farid had problems delivering packages, but his proximity to local residents also made Farid get help. \u201cAt that time, I was pointed at with a 2 meter machete by a customer because I felt that the items ordered were not appropriate and wanted to ask for my money back. For 1 week I was always terrorized but Alhamdulillah because I was close to other customers there I was even guarded in the sense that at that time someone was blocking and expelling him, even I was close to the village head, so I was assisted by the village head and Babinsa to settle the family amicably\u201d said Farid telling his experience.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">As a delivery sprinter, Farid divides his delivery routes to be more efficient. He always delivers to the city area which consists of offices and schools first in the afternoon and followed by a delivery to the Mount Dompu area. The mountain area he is currently delivering is as large as the city because he is trusted and asked by customers to deliver packages in the mountain area. Everyday he spends about 4-5 hours for the Mountain area until the evening. Not infrequently he also had to face the route home without lighting so he had to be extra careful. \u201cOnce I arrived at 1 am at 12.12 am just coming back from the mountain area because at that time the corn was already mass harvesting so it could reach up to 450 delivery packages,\u201d recalls Farid.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Entering the National Shopping Day at the end of the year and also the rainy season is certainly a challenge for sprinters. Farid said that when it rains he doesn&#39;t have any major problems, generally he contacts the customer first to inform them that he will deliver the package and ask about the weather conditions there, and he even has coffee prepared by the customer when it arrives.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Responsible for customer packages, Farid sometimes uses his clothes to wipe the package baskets. \u201cWhen it rains sometimes it&#39;s called a mountainous area, right, there is no place to rest and the basket is indeed waterproof, but there must be water ingress, so sometimes the clothes for rags don&#39;t get too much water. To prepare for the peak season, they tend to listen to music as encouragement and spend more time sorting goods and encouraging each other at the drop point.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><br\/><\/p>","freleasedate":"2021-11-25"}]},{"October":[{"fid":61,"fadddate":"2021-10-27 12:09:20","fimg":"\/indexUploads\/images\/20211027\/3fcb504878f6dda9ddd49d80cb5a311d.jpg,\/indexUploads\/images\/20211027\/0cf68462103bb2e8a935b302ce608e9c.jpg","lang_title":"Pioneering Career Starting From Zero, Isaiah Successfully Tracked Career To Manager Level","lang_bi":"","lang_content":"<p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Yesaya Bagus Wicahyo&#39;s career journey by joining J&amp;T Express East Java began in December 2015 as a sprinter in the Mojokerto area.

Less than a year he was trusted to be a new Drop Point Supervisor for placement in Surabaya and started from scratch for new challenges, all of which he did with maximum performance until he filled the Manager level.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&quot;In the beginning, several sprinters resigned and left several empty areas and no one has handled them, with full readiness, I volunteered to handle all the sub-districts so that there would be no accumulation of delivery packages while arranging between delivery and pick-up,&quot; said Isaiah. It turned out that his initiative to minimize the accumulation of packages was not arbitrary, Isaiah handled the delivery of packages to 6 sub-districts by setting the time to leave for work early and return late at night to be able to complete all the routes he had arranged every day. Not to forget, he also confirmed to the customer that he would pick up the package every 4 pm so that the package was ready for pickup and did not waste time waiting. In this way he does consistently and his performance continues to improve.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Mid-2016 Isaiah no longer picks up packages by leaving in the morning and returning at night, but focuses on supervising Wiyung&#39;s DP in the Surabaya area, where he tries to develop the DP gradually and set new strategies again. Unlike before, if in big cities the morning incoming packages can arrive early in the morning, so he has to work on it himself instead of the sprinter team to receive the package because of the consideration of sufficient rest time for the sprinter team who must be fit on the road during package delivery. For almost 3 months Isaiah slept in the DP to arrange an optimal work rhythm and set the sprinter schedule for delivery and pick up so that everything was done on time. So, this is where Isaiah sets an example and directs his team to always be able to complete their respective responsibilities.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">These efforts did not necessarily run smoothly, he had an unpleasant experience when there was embezzlement of company money by certain individuals, so he was in a race against time to resolve the problem to the authorities until it was finished, but it did not stop there, Isaiah was responsible for replacing all losses incurred. experienced at that time. Although it felt heavy, he did not give up, the event became an evaluation for him and turned him into motivation to do better. Finally he managed to bring DP wiyung to be the best Drop Point at that time with the achievement of becoming a branch with the best pick ups and quality and then he was again trusted to be Asst.

As a new employee, Indra needs a lot to learn, in a day he is able to send approximately 100 packages, in addition to a quite remote location too. because I still don&#39;t know the ins and outs of setting up the package delivery area that he will live through.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\u201cWhen I first became a permanent employee, I felt that my job was different from when I worked daily. The main difference is that there are more workloads, bigger responsibilities, more optimized service and professional work, &quot;said Indra. &quot;Because I remember what my original goal was to work for, so I have to be enthusiastic!&quot; he added.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Often he is asked by customers about packages that have not arrived at the address, even though he is running the delivery process one by one to the customer&#39;s address. But for him it is a natural thing for customers to ask about the whereabouts of the package and as much as possible he responds politely even if someone asks repeatedly.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Indra also experienced difficulty explaining when the delivery of packages that had been stored for several days because the recipient had no response when contacted, when he was successfully connected, Indra immediately informed him that he would deliver the next day because the route was going the same way. However, he got a complaint right the next day, there Indra felt that his patience was being tested to find a solution and rushed to the address of the recipient to communicate well until finally the customer could understand after being well explained.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Customers are family, as Indra called them. He considers every customer he meets not just looking for addresses, delivering packages and leaving, but in addition to carrying out standard procedures he tries to be friendly and polite, from small things such as delivering on time, greeting customers, responding to customer questions, so that customer familiarity will also be intertwined even like brothers.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&quot;It&#39;s not that I&#39;m hungry, but the customers here when I drop off or pick up a package often give me little attention, such as offering drinking water, saying to be careful with the package, and some are always offering food. yes, I take that as a bonus and encouragement to work. &quot; he said<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Now Indra already has customers from big stores, all he gets from his hard work and also his ability to communicate with customers, this experience has taught him to appreciate the process until in 2019 he was awarded the best employee in West Sumatra and was invited to Jakarta. on the Jet Lympic activity.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">As time went on, Indra was getting better at carrying out his duties, already cleverly managing the delivery of packages for his work area until he was transferred to the sales sprinter division but still in the same area. Here he has a new focus besides delivering packages but also picking up packages to customers&#39; homes and with certain targets in order to achieve maximum results.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Indra is very grateful to work at J&amp;T Express, according to him for now he is working in the right company, especially in the midst of a pandemic, many employees have lost their jobs while their jobs are getting denser, so that he already has savings from his income while working and is even able to own his own motorbike, and relationship that keeps increasing.<\/span><\/p><p><br\/><\/p>","freleasedate":"2020-12-23"}]},{"November":[{"fid":50,"fadddate":"2020-11-28 11:12:08","fimg":"\/indexUploads\/images\/20201128\/c9db27778db800b28f926a57c7cc293d.jpg,\/indexUploads\/images\/20201128\/84b0efd3126f5448d2c48d3b0fa7dd43.jpg","lang_title":"Receiving an Appreciation Prize in the Form of a Motorcycle for His Performance, This Employee Was Once Expelled By a Customer","lang_bi":"","lang_content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Wahyu Saputra (20), the Tanjung Pinang drop point delivery sprinter, has joined J&amp;T Express since 2 years ago. Wahyu said that so far he had only worked according to his responsibilities and as best he could. Indeed, he did not deny, the achievements of his colleagues who received a reward from the company a year ago also motivated him to work harder, but unexpectedly thanks to his persistence at work, Wahyu was appreciated as an employee with very high dedication and loyalty to get a Scoopy Motorbike from J&amp;T Express Riau last September 2020.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Not using the prize for his own sake, he feels that the motorcycle he has is sufficient to support his needs as a sprinter without the need to use a new motorcycle. As a result, he gave the motorbike to his parents because his parents&#39; motorbikes were often damaged. As the backbone of the family, Wahyu certainly wants to provide the best for his parents. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect my performance to be appreciated by the company because in my opinion, I only work according to my job.

Every day, Wahyu delivers 150-200 packages per day, the route he always delivers is quite unique, namely a village area with minimal lighting, especially at night, which sprinter may rarely travel in big cities.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">During the peak season, Wahyu once sorted packages with colleagues until 10 PM in order to make it easier and to be able to complete package delivery immediately to customers.

His main task is to deliver and also pick up the package to the customer&#39;s address, of course not just any delivery, but he must arrange the travel time and estimate the delivery route appropriately to be able to catch the package pick up on the same day.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">A unique incident he experienced while carrying out his first assignment, at that time Edi was chasing time to pick up a package to a shop, without realizing that the Kronjo containing the package he was carrying was lost because it fell during the trip, where there was one package he had to take between that day. He also retraced the route that was passed but could not find it, felt that he had failed to carry out his job, he also had to be responsible for the package he was carrying, Edi decided to go directly to the customer&#39;s address intending to apologize and would replace it.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Upon arrival, it turned out that the package had been received so there was no need to replace it, as well as the lost kronjo that were back at the Drop Point. A fortune for Edi, it turns out that the fallen Kronjo has been taken to the Drop Point by someone else who finds it on the road. He takes lessons from this experience so that he becomes more careful while delivering packages to customers. After 3 months of carrying out his duties smoothly, Edi was entrusted with carrying out his duties as assistant coordinator (assistant) at Drop Point BKI 01, Bekasi.<br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Carrying out new responsibilities and new job challenges, Edi never complains, he is determined to keep trying to provide the best work results, this time the challenge he found at peak season, he is responsible for arranging all incoming packages so that they can be sorted immediately On the same day, besides that, Edi was also backing up another temporary job.<br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&quot;I happened to have a job at that time from PIC that I was backing up, because at that time his wife was going to give birth.

The figure born in 1988 is really simple and inspires that all types of work enable us to achieve a better life with perseverance and hard work.<\/span><\/p><p><br\/><\/p>","freleasedate":"2016-12-23"}]},{"November":[{"fid":39,"fadddate":"2020-01-16 11:02:03","fimg":"\/indexUploads\/images\/20200116\/99e1d0def2a80157de3edce1d2e222cc.jpg","lang_title":"Superwoman Sprinter","lang_bi":"","lang_content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Sprinter or courier is usually a job that is generally done by men because this work is known as heavy work, in addition to being required to know the route of the sprinter is also required to have strong stamina. But what if this is done by women?<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This unusual figure at the Aceh branch drop point, Ariska Delima, born in 1992, is the first female sprinter at the Banda Aceh drop point. As a woman Ariska claimed not to mind doing work as a courier, for her this job is challenging and comfortable to do. Previously Riska worked as a cashier at one of the minimarkets in Aceh, but she wanted to do something new with J&amp;T Express.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><br\/><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 0em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;\">Generate 700 Pick Ups in 1 Month<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In addition to being a sprinter Riska also supports marketing activities that support sales at the Aceh drop point, the virgin, who is the fourth child of four siblings, was even able to produce 700 pick ups in August. Mr. Robby, as the General Manager in Banda Aceh, acknowledged Riska&#39;s excellence and sincerity in his work despite initially being hesitant to accept women as sprinter, but this doubt was answered with Riska 9&#39;s performance this month. Besides having a commitment to work Riska is also considered to have integrity so that customers give a positive outlook to J&amp;T Express. &quot;Riska&#39;s performance is indeed good, her work is arguably more than that of men, she also proves she can work as a sprinter as well as marketing. He even refused when the customer gave additional tips when delivering the package because he felt he had received a salary from J&amp;T Express &quot;said Mr. Robby.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">For Riska working as a sprinter is a new and exciting thing to do. &quot;At first, people were surprised, but after a long time it was normal and fun, the family also all supported as long as they liked it,&quot; said Riska who was still shy when interviewed by the J&amp;T Express team.<\/span><\/p><p><br\/><\/p>","freleasedate":"2016-11-23"}]},{"July":[{"fid":40,"fadddate":"2020-01-16 11:42:33","fimg":"\/indexUploads\/images\/20200116\/9cc9073255c429ccacb45793e225ca17.jpg","lang_title":"From Zero to Hero","lang_bi":"","lang_content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">From Zero to Hero, from just a messenger to a VIP operational supervisor, maybe that is a suitable parable for Mr Usman Sudrajat&#39;s (32) career. This man born in Pandeglang started his career as a messenger or delivery of letters and documents at the OPPO headquarters, South Jakarta. Since 2013 Mr. Usman has devoted himself wholeheartedly to the formation of J&amp;T Express in 2015, Mr. Usman has been working as one of the sprinter \/ package senders at Season City drop points. Thanks to Mr. Usman&#39;s diligence in his work, Mr. Usman has now been appointed as a VIP operational supervisor in the VIP division or a division that handles large e-commerce customers at J&amp;T Express.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;&quot;Yes, you must be diligent, don&#39;t complain, if you are told to obey do not be annoyed, also do not forget to learn many new things,&quot; said Pak Usman when asked what tips to have a work spirit that takes us up the level at work. Now Pak Usman has economic improvements as well as better leadership experience. Leading many sprinters to be able to work according to the applicable procedures and ensure that all shipments run smoothly is not easy, but this is a new challenge that refers to Mr. Usman becoming a future leader.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Mr. Usman won the Best Employee 2016 at the OPPO J&amp;T Express Annual Gathering held at Ancol Beach City on July 14. In addition to bringing home the award trophy, Mr. Usman also received Rp.10,000,000 in cash as an appreciation of his hard work and loyalty to the company. &quot;There are no results that betray the business&quot; JT Friends, if we work wholeheartedly and try to give our best<\/span><\/p><p><br\/><\/p>","freleasedate":"2016-07-18"}]}]}])
